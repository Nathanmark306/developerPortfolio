          <p>
            The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500
            companies has allowed me to developer a skillset that helps me in
            not just development, but in every aspect of any business.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;m proud to announce that I am now working at one of the
            world&apos;s largest communities teaching young minds about how to
            sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of
            opportunities.

            As a developer, you have everything available to you and all thatc
            holding you back is yourself.

          <p>A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean,</p>
          <p>
            &quot;How big would you dream, if you knew you wouldn&apos;t
            fail?&quot; You&apos;ve already gone through the hardest parts being
            a developer, its time to elevate your skills and become a leader in
            something you&apos;re passionate about.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;m happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help
            your company.
